rainy-module
============

A puppet module for the Rainy note sync server.

You can read more about the Rainy server at:

http://www.notesync.org/#!index.md

This module tries to be a Debian-centric method by which Rainy can be configured and installed in a reasonable, sensible fashion.
It includes templates for the settings, an initscript, and an initial runscript to wrap the mono execution path..
